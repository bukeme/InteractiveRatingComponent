## My process

### Built with

-CSS custom properties

### What i learned

I learned how to use css media query, css float, clearfix hack, just to mention but a few

### Continued development

CSS flexbox and CSS grid are the best to use for this kind of project but i used CSS float because i apparently don't have broad knowledge on CSS flexbox and CSS grid.
In the nearest future(period of days), i'll go in-depth in  CSS flexbox and CSS grid.
